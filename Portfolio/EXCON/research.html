		<h2>Research Overview</h2>
			<p>The WCC is an organized crime group consisting of clowns who traffic most of the helium our world produces for either themselves or marked up through partners. </p>
			<p>This page features three key pieces of evidence that reveals the truth behind this crisis, thanks to the vailiant Chuck Thompson</p>

		<h3>Leaked Internal Memo from the World Clown Consortium (WCC)</h3>
			<a href=""><img src="" alt="Clown units,
It has come to our attention that several of our helium transport trucks were flagged by customs authorities last week. Ensure future shipments are masked as standard carnival supplies. If questioned, divert attention to balloon animal demonstrations and if that doesn't work; throw pies.
All helium canisters must arrive at our hidden storage in the abandoned circus warehouses by the end of this quarter. Failure to meet this deadline will jeopardize our monopoly on the world's helium reserves. Remember, no helium, no balloons - no balloons, no 'joy'.
Proceed with discretion, or else."

		<h3>Confidential Surveillance Footage from "Operation Red Nose"</h3>
			<a href=""><img src="" alt="In 2022, a joint task force led by several international governments, dubbed 'Operation Red Nose,' was formed after suspicious helium shortages were reported worldwide. The task force obtained confidential surveillance footage from a cargo yard in Hong Kong. The footage shows a group of clowns loading unmarked helium canisters onto an unregistered cargo vessel."

		<h3>Whistleblower Testimony</h3>
			<a href=""><img src="" alt="I worked as a professional clown for over ten years, performing at birthday parties and corporate events. Everything seemed normal until one day, during a clown convention, I overheard the higher-ups talking about something that didn’t sit right with me. They were discussing how helium prices were going up, and yet, they always seemed to have an endless supply."
