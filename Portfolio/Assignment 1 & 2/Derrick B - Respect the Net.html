<p>In her article, "404 Page Not Found" Kate Wagner analyzes the internet and how fragile it really is. Near the beginning of the article, Wagner highlighted an old warning commonly passed around "be careful what you post online because it'll be there forever." Although the internet should always be used with caution, the statement that something you post online will stay there forever is far from the case. Wagner explores this concept of an "eternal" internet and explains how the internet of the past, the one she had grown up with had eventually grown completely obsolete with her having trouble finding the exact websites that she loved visiting with her dad as a child. </p>
<p>As the article continues, she mentions platforms such as GeoCities and Myspace nearly being purged off the internet, with Myspace being the one behind removing their users and their accounts and subsequent information off the site. Wagner continues this topic, likening the abandonment of these sites to real-world counter parts. As we continue to focus more and more on our devices and our ability to socialize on those, places that were dedicated for socializing like parks and malls have steadily been growing rarer and rarer. Funnily enough the same goes for the internet, and although there is a steady stream of people coming to the internet, that in itself is making us appreciate the internet less and less.</p>
<p>As more people use the internet, more focus is put on optimizing to get to the next step, while some of the oldest websites are being lost to time. Because of this, Wagner stresses the importance of digital preservation efforts and questions what happens when our collective knowledge, stories, and culture vanish, alluding to this in the title of the article being "404 Page Not Found."</p>
<p>Wagner's article was intended to make us as the audience rethink how we value the internet and the plethora of things it has provided us. From social media, search engines, entertainment, and education, the internet has been responsible for completely changing the way in which we live. Although I never was able to really experience the "old" web, I was able to grow up experiencing the "new" internet as it continued to grow and grow. Now there have been efforts to revive a lot of the content found on the old internet, with websites like Archive.org being one of the biggest, even looking at some of the stuff on there is like seeing something that should've never been seen.</p>
<p>I think I can speak for all of my generation in saying that we genuinely cannot fathom a world in which we don't have immediate access to the internet, and I'm sure older generations can't imagine going back to the ways things were. The internet has been optimized to a point where literally anything is possible on there, but because it's reached a point of perfection, we really take it for granted. The internet is immense and holds such a great degree of information, but we honestly tend to just use it for a handful of reasons. Even while writing this, I'm thinking of how something like this had to be done, because programs like Word or Google Docs didn't way back when, people had to create websites that would host information. It's genuinely fascinating to imagine that kind of world for my generation, since we've always had programs like this to help us.</p>
<p>Even though we've reached what seems to be the pinnacle, I think what we can all take from Kate Wagner's experience is to just appreciate the value that the internet has and has provided to all of us.</p>
