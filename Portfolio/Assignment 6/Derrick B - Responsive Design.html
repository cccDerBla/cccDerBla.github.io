	<h2>Ultimately, in terms of NYC-style versus Chicago's deep dish, hungry folks desiring to indulge in a thick, chunky, delicious, and hearty pizza during a seated dining experience would appreciate the latter. But city-dwellers on the go who don't have much time on their hands (nor wanting pizza all over said hands) will likely prefer a slicker, more convenient New York slice - that is just as tasty as its Chicago sister but much easier and quicker to eat. Thus, it's not just about flavor and pizza consistency; the winner of this pizza battle really depends on who is eating the pizza, when they're eating it, and where they're eating it.</h2>

	<h1>Derrick Blancas</h1>
	<h2>The whole "depends on who's eating it" is cool and I can't argue with that, but there is a unanimous answer to this debate. While Chicago's deep dish is super good and filling, I've eaten way more NYC-style pizza's in my life. Deep dish has always been sort of a treat in my eyes, the type of thing you can only eat once in a while, and even though the NYC slice is basically the same nutritionally, it's so much easier to eat and honestly better in my eyes.</h2>/*
